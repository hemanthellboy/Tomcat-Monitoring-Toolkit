# Tomcat Monitoring Toolkit

🔥 **What problem this solves**

Monitoring and managing Tomcat servers effectively can be a challenging task, especially in dynamic environments where performance bottlenecks can go undetected.

❌ **The pain today**

- Lack of native tools for effective and seamless monitoring of Tomcat servers.
- Difficulty in identifying performance bottlenecks in production environments.
- Inefficient debugging when server performance issues arise.

✔️ **What this repo fixes**

The Tomcat Monitoring Toolkit provides a robust, ready-to-use solution for real-time server performance monitoring, helping DevOps teams and administrators optimize the performance and reliability of [...]

⚡ **Quick start**

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hemanthellboy/Tomcat-Monitoring-Toolkit.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the directory**
   ```bash
   cd Tomcat-Monitoring-Toolkit
   ```
3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   ./start-monitoring.sh
   ```
4. **Access the dashboard**
   Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/dashboard`.

🧠 **How it works**

The Tomcat Monitoring Toolkit integrates directly with your Tomcat server to capture key performance metrics through JMX (Java Management Extensions) connectors and system interfaces. Below is a simpl[...] 

```plaintext
+------------------+           +-----------------------+           +------------------+
| Tomcat Instance  | --JMX--> | Monitoring Connector | --> Data --> | Web Dashboard   |
+------------------+           +-----------------------+           +------------------+
```

🛡️ **Security / limitations**

- Includes basic auth for the dashboard interface; additional security layers are recommended for production.
- Currently tested with Tomcat 9+; compatibility with older versions may vary.
- Ensure firewalls allow JMX connectors for remote monitoring.
